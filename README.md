# ðŸ¥¨ Pretzel

Pretzel is a recursive JSON data validation, created out of frustration since there are no npm modules that can recursively validate a JSON object with multiple nested values objects.

We are aware of Validate.js, but as the author explains, the [support for complete object is very basic](https://validatejs.org/#validate-nested). We did consider proposing a PR to the project, but the source code turned out to be to hard to rezone about, and thus Pretzel was born.

The goal of this tools is not only to handle nested JSON files like this:

```
{
	first_name: 'David',
	last_name: 'Gatti',
	age: 99,
	address: {
		street: 'Wonder Land',
		nr: 55,
		state: 'TX',
		country: 'United States'
	}
}
```

With rules structured this way:

```
{
	first_name: {
		type: 'string'
	},
	last_name: {
		regexp: '[a-zA-Z]'
	},
	age: {
		type: 'number'
	},
	address: {
		street: {
			type: 'string'
		},
		nr: {
			type: 'number'
		},
		state: {
			includes: ['AL', 'AK', 'AZ', 'AR', 'CA', 'CO', 'CT', 'DE', 'DC', 'FL', 'GA', 'HI', 'ID', 'IL', 'IN', 'IA', 'KS', 'KY', 'LA', 'ME', 'MD', 'MA', 'MI', 'MN', 'MS', 'MO', 'MT', 'NE', 'NV', 'NH', 'NJ', 'NM', 'NY', 'NC', 'ND', 'OH', 'OK', 'OR', 'PA', 'RI', 'SC', 'SD', 'TN', 'TX', 'UT', 'VT', 'VA', 'WA', 'WV', 'WI', 'WY']
		},
		country: {
			includes: ['United States', 'Canada']
		}
	}
}
```

We also wanted to make sure the source code is a simple to understand. If you check the `index.js` file you'll see that we mean. We hope that his way you can learn something or modify the code to suits your needs.
