# ðŸ¥¨ Pretzel

Pretzel is a recursive JSON data validation, created after realizing that there are no npm modules that can recursively validate a JSON object with multiple nested values objects.

We are aware of Validate.js, but as the author explains, the [support for complete object is very basic](https://validatejs.org/#validate-nested). We did consider proposing a PR to the project, but the source code turned out to be to hard to rezone about, and thus Pretzel was born.

The goal of this tools is not only to handle nested JSON files like this:

```javascript
{
	first_name: 'David',
	last_name: 'Gatti',
	age: 99,
	address: {
		street: 'Wonder Land',
		nr: 55,
		state: 'TX',
		country: 'United States'
	}
}
```

With rules structured this way:

```javascript
{
	first_name: {
		type: 'string'
	},
	last_name: {
		regexp: '[a-zA-Z]'
	},
	age: {
		type: 'number'
	},
	address: {
		street: {
			type: 'string'
		},
		nr: {
			type: 'number'
		},
		state: {
			includes: ['AL', 'AK', 'AZ', 'AR', 'CA', 'CO', 'CT', 'DE', 'DC', 'FL', 'GA', 'HI', 'ID', 'IL', 'IN', 'IA', 'KS', 'KY', 'LA', 'ME', 'MD', 'MA', 'MI', 'MN', 'MS', 'MO', 'MT', 'NE', 'NV', 'NH', 'NJ', 'NM', 'NY', 'NC', 'ND', 'OH', 'OK', 'OR', 'PA', 'RI', 'SC', 'SD', 'TN', 'TX', 'UT', 'VT', 'VA', 'WA', 'WV', 'WI', 'WY']
		},
		country: {
			includes: ['United States', 'Canada']
		}
	}
}
```

We also wanted to make the source code as simple to understand as possible. If you check the `index.js` file you'll see what we mean â€“ use it, modify it, learn from it.
